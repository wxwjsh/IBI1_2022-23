The results showed that humans were most closely related to cats, followed by humans and mice, and cats and mice were least closely related.
Biologically, this suggests that HUMAN and CAT share a more recent common ancestor than either species shares with MOUSE. 
This may indirectly prove that all life on Earth began as a single cell in ancient times and evolved over a long period of time to create a diversity of species. This is because, genetically speaking, all species on Earth are related to each other, only in a distant way.
